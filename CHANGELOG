* Add deprecation warning for --key option.  Users should use
  --gpg-local-user instead.  --key will be removed in 1.0.

* Allow forwarding of select gpg options with commands like
--gpg-homedir.  run `gem verify --help` to see a list of all options.

* Fail gracefully when rubygems.org doesn't return owner list, for
  example when a gem has never been published to rubygems.org.

0.6.0 - 2013-03-18
==================

* --trust now automatically implies --verify.  #29

* Look up a gem's owner at rubygems.org if possible, and verify that
  this matches a trusted UID on the signing key, if possible.

* Provide installer links if we can't find gpg.

* Allow `gem verify foo-0.0.0.gem --trust`

* Show 8 digit short id, not 9 digits.

0.5.1 - 2013-03-10
==================

* Read/write files in binary mode so Windows doesn't mess with newlines.

0.5.0 - 2013-03-10
==================

* Signing/Verifying silently skips existing signature files, and
	warns if we see an unexpected non-gz file type.

* Moved run_gpg to gpg_status_parser gem and updated required version.

* Show "Verifying GEM..." before verifying.  Otherwise it's confusing
  when multiple signed dependencies are downloaded.

* Added ssh-style continuity checking.  The first time you get a gem, 
  its fingerprint is stored in ~/.rubygems-openpgp/known_gems.  If the 
  fingerprint changes, you get an error.

0.4.0 - 2013-02-23
==================

* Added --trust and --no-trust options which enforce gnupg trust so we
  don't install valid but untrusted gems.

* We now use gpg_status_parser instead of just dealing with gpg
  stdout, etc.

* --no-verify to explicitly override --verify.  Useful if you specify
    --verify in ~/.gemrc

0.3.0 - 2013-02-10
==================

* `gem build --sign [--key 0xDEADBEEF]` will now sign gems on build.

* 'gem install --verify' will now verify gems or abort install.

* Escape potentially unsafe user input.  (Patch via postmodern)

0.2.1 - 2011-05-30
==================

* Binary release at rubygems wasn't signed.

0.2.0 - 2011-05-30
==================

* Basic smoke test.

* Moved a bunch of code and refactored to make testing easier.

* Provide a friendly error if gem isn't found when signing.

* Provide a friendly error if gem isn't found when verifying.

* We no longer accidentally swallowing the command line validation in
  SignCommand.

* Validate that actual key id is in the form of 0xDEADBEEF to
  eliminate potential gpg trickery.

* Validate gpg install when running any OpenPGP operation.

1.1 - 2011-05-28
================

* Fix for windows verification, files must be opened in binary mode.

1.0 - Initial Release - 2011-05-28
==================================
